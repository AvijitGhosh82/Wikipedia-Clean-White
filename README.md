# Wikipedia-Clean-White


A clean white theme for Wikipedia. Inspired by the 1911 theme and Wikiwand. It is cleaner and uses serif font to make the content look more academic.

I made this quick style when I saw Wikiwand had gone paid, and so it might be rough around the edges.I'll work on it from time to time, but community additions are welcome. Please contribute!
